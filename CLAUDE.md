# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

OricScreenEditorLOCI is a from-scratch **Oscar64** rewrite of
[OricScreenEditor](https://github.com/xahmol/OricScreenEditor) (V1, CC65,
local checkout at `/home/xahmol/git/OricScreenEditor`) — a character-set-aware
screen editor for the Oric Atmos — extended with support for the **LOCI mass
storage device**.

**Goal / planned additions over V1:**
- File browsing and file I/O via LOCI (load/save screens, charsets, etc. from
  LOCI storage instead of tape only)
- Overlay RAM ($C000-$FFFF, LOCI-backed) for extra working memory (e.g. window
  save/restore, undo buffers)
- Enhanced palette mode that also shows the inverse colour combinations for
  each ink/paper pair

**Status: build-chain scaffold only.** A previous CC65-based attempt at this
got stuck and is archived in the `nonworkingcc65` branch (full history +
uncommitted state). `main` was restarted from scratch on the Oscar64
native/bare-metal build chain developed for
[locifilemanager-v2](https://github.com/xahmol/locifilemanager-v2)
(`/home/xahmol/git/locifilemanager-v2`), which the runtime and libraries below
were copied from verbatim. No OSE-specific editor logic (charset editor,
screen editor modes, palette/inverse-colour, LOCI file browser UI) exists yet
— `src/main.c` is currently a minimal smoke test only.

**Feature-set reference:** `README.md` / `README.pdf` and `screenshots/`
describe V1's UI and feature set (main mode, character editor, palette mode,
select/move/line-box/write modes, file format) — this is the spec the rewrite
needs to (eventually) match and then extend. `assets/*.bin` (charset/title/
help screens, Petscii charset) are Oric-format binaries carried over from V1
and may be reusable as-is.

## Compiler Toolchain

This is an **Oscar64** project. `oscar64manual.md` is in the project root —
consult it for compiler flags, pragmas, language extensions, and gotchas. The
Oscar64 binary is at `$OSCAR64_HOME/bin/oscar64` (Makefile defaults
`OSCAR64_HOME` to `~/oscar64`).

Target: 6502A (Oric Atmos), bare-metal. No VIC-II, SID, or C64 Kernal.

**Critical Oscar64 gotchas (all documented in oscar64manual.md):**
- `va_arg` is broken in native mode (`-n`) — do not use `<stdarg.h>` /
  `va_list` / `va_arg`.
- `#if MACRO` fails when macro is defined via `-d` flag (no value) — use
  `#ifdef MACRO`.
- `(type)struct.member` — Oscar64 applies cast before member access; use a
  temp variable.
- Macro that expands to a volatile read in a braces-free for-loop body causes
  a parse error; use a braced body with an explicit temp.
- Ternary `? ptr : 0` in a pointer-returning function — use `if`/`return`
  instead.

## Build and Run

```
make              # build build/oseloci.tap
make run          # build + launch in Oricutron
make clean        # remove build artifacts
make docs         # regenerate README.pdf from README.md (requires pandoc)
```

Compiler flags: `-n -tf=bin -rt=include/oric_crt.c -i=include -i=src -O2 -dNOFLOAT`

Emulator: `$ORICUTRON_HOME/oricutron -ma --serial none --vsynchack off --turbotape on`
(Makefile defaults `ORICUTRON_HOME` to `~/oricutron`)

## Memory Layout (`include/oric_crt.c`)

Custom Oscar64 runtime, copied from locifilemanager-v2. Full details and
rationale are in the file's header comment; summary:

- `$0000-$00FF` — Zero page (Oscar64 internal registers)
- `$0100-$01FF` — 6502 hardware stack
- `$0200-$04FF` — Oric ROM system variables (do not use)
- `$0500-$057F` — Startup region (tape entry point -> `oric_startup`)
- `$0580-$B1FF` — Program code, data, BSS, heap (~42.4 KB)
- `$B200-$B3FF` — Oscar64 software stack (512 bytes)
- `$B400-$BBFF` — Character set RAM (left untouched — `$B400` is OSDK's
  documented ceiling for user code/data)
- `$BB80-$FFFF` — Screen RAM (`$BB80`) + ROM (`$C000`)
- `$C000-$FFFF` — Overlay RAM, **requires LOCI device**, not mapped as code

**IRQ convention:** interrupts are left disabled (`SEI`, no `CLI`) — the
keyboard scanner polls directly, no IRQ handler is installed. Any code that
must briefly enable IRQs (overlay RAM access via `MICRODISCCFG`, VIA Port A
access in `ijk.c`) **must** use `PHP; SEI ... PLP`, never `SEI ... CLI` — an
unconditional `CLI` would permanently re-enable IRQs and let the stock ROM IRQ
handler corrupt zero page / screen RAM.

## Source Layout

```
src/
  main.c          Application entry point (currently: minimal smoke test)
  strings.h       User-visible message strings (MSG_* macros required by loci.c)
include/
  oric.h          Hardware constants (VIA, AY, screen, overlay RAM, ASTR_*/CH_*/A_* attrs)
  oric_crt.c      Custom Oscar64 runtime: startup, regions, math stubs
  crt_math.c      Math/float runtime routines for the custom runtime
  keyboard.h/c    Direct VIA/AY keyboard scanner — no ROM calls
  charwin.h/c     Character window / menu library
  loci.h/c        LOCI mass storage API (MIA/TAP/XRAM/file/dir/mount/overlay RAM)
  ijk.h/c         Raxiss IJK joystick driver (VIA Port A; independent of LOCI)
tools/
  mktap.py        Wraps .bin in Oric tape header
build/
  oseloci.tap     Output tape image (gitignored)
```

All library files (`oric_crt.c`, `crt_math.c`, `oric.h`, `charwin.*`,
`keyboard.*`, `ijk.*`, `loci.*`) were copied verbatim from
locifilemanager-v2 — see that project's CLAUDE.md and `oscar64manual.md` for
their full API documentation (charwin window model, attribute macros, key
codes, MIA/TAP register layout, MIA helper calling conventions, etc.).
`src/strings.h` here is a minimal placeholder (just the two `MSG_*` macros
`loci.c`'s `get_locicfg()` needs) — locifilemanager-v2's full EN/FR
`strings.h`/`strings_en.h`/`strings_fr.h` localisation system was deliberately
**not** copied; revisit if/when localisation is needed.

## Oric Screen Model

- **40×28 character grid**, screen RAM at `$BB80`
- **Serial attributes:** byte with `(byte & 0x60) == 0` is an attribute
  (values 0x00-0x1F only). `0x20` (space) is a character, not an attribute.
  ULA resets to white-ink/black-paper at the start of each raster line, then
  applies attrs left-to-right.
- **Inverse video:** `ch | 0x80` inverts pixel rendering; `CH_INVSPACE`
  (0xA0) = solid ink-coloured block.
